Building asm80 is weird: it's a multimodule file, but each module is assembled
standalone at a fixed address and then all the binaries are concatenated
together. Each module starts with a jump to the next module and then a jump table.

This is so that the whole assembler can be rebuilt with itself (asm80 doesn't
produce relocatable output files which can be fed to a linker, remember). I've
opted not to rework it to use normal modules as this seems valuable.
