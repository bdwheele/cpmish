This has been massaged lightly by me, dtrg, to assemble with zmac. The main
issue is that zmac doesn't allow labels like OR and AND and has slightly
different conditional syntax. Very little work was needed.

Additional note: previously, the CP/M runtime (such as it is) and the
interpreter were combined. I've moved the common interpreter stuff into
camel80i.inc.
