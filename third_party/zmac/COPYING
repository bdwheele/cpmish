Updates and bugfixes over the years by John Providenza, Colin Kelley, and more
recently by Russell Marks, Mark RISON, Chris Smith, Matthew Phillips and Tim
Mann.

Extensive modifications for cycle counting, multiple output formats, ".rel"
output, 8080 mode and older assembler compatibilty were written by George
Phillips.

This document was based on Russell Marks zmac man page which had tweaks by Mark
RISON and Tim Mann. George Phillips converted it to HTML and documented the new
features and some older ones (e.g., phase/dephase).  ï¿¼ To the extent possible
